      "strStadiumDescription": "The Emirates Stadium (known as Ashburton Grove prior to sponsorship, and as Arsenal Stadium for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Holloway, London, England, and the home of Arsenal. With a capacity of 60,704 it is the fourth-largest football stadium in England after Wembley Stadium, Old Trafford and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Arsenal explored the possibility of relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by Islington Council to expand its home stadium, Highbury. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley Stadium), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later, they received the council's approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger described this as the \"biggest decision in Arsenal's history\" since the board appointed Herbert Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. The entire stadium project was completed in 2006 at a cost of \u00a3390 million. The club's former stadium was redeveloped as Highbury Square, an apartment complex.\r\n\r\nThe stadium has undergone a process of \"Arsenalisation\" since 2009 with the aim of restoring Arsenal's heritage and history. The stadium has hosted international fixtures and music concerts.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England, that plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The club has won 13 League titles, a record 13 FA Cups, 2 League Cups, 15 FA Community Shields, 1 League Centenary Trophy, 1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and 1 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.\r\n\r\nArsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970\u201371, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.\r\n\r\nHerbert Chapman won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers, and added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's kit. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record 7 FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. In terms of revenue, Arsenal is the ninth highest-earning football club in the world, earned \u20ac487.6m in 2016\u201317 season. Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015, Arsenal's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world. In 2018, Forbes estimated the club was the third most valuable in England, with the club being worth $2.24 billion.",

Inoltre \u00e8 una delle tredici squadre che hanno raggiunto le finali di tutte le tre principali competizioni gestite dalla UEFA: Champions League (2005-2006), Coppa UEFA (1999-2000) e Coppa delle Coppe (1979-1980, 1993-1994 e 1994-1995).[6]\r\n\r\nI colori sociali, rosso per la maglietta e bianco per i pantaloncini, hanno sub\u00ecto variazioni pi\u00f9 o meno evidenti nel corso degli anni.

It has been the home of Aston Villa Football Club since 1897. The team previously played at Aston Park from 1874 to 1876 and Wellington Road from 1876 to 1897. The ground is less than a mile from both Witton and Aston railway stations and has hosted sixteen England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899 and the most recent in 2005. It was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park has hosted more FA Cup semi-finals than any other stadium, having hosted 55 matches in total.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Aston Villa moved into the Aston Lower Grounds, a sports ground in a Victorian amusement park situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home. Over the course of its history the stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road Stand, North Stand and the Doug Ellis Stand. The club has initial planning permission to redevelop the North Stand, which will increase the capacity of Villa Park from 42,682 to approximately 50,000.\r\n\r\nBefore 1914 a cycling track ran around the perimeter of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was unavailable due to it staging the final of the Olympic football tournament.",

Crystal Palace is considered the club's main rival, although the grounds are 40 miles apart.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1901, Brighton played their early professional football in the Southern League before being elected to the Football League in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the First Division and reached the 1983 FA Cup Final, losing to Manchester United after a replay. They were relegated from the top division in the same season. Mismanagement brought Brighton close to relegation from the Football League to the Conference which they narrowly avoided in 1997 and 1998. A boardroom takeover saved Brighton from liquidation, and following successive promotions they returned to the second tier of English football in 2002 and have played in the second and third tiers ever since.",

      "strStadiumDescription": "Turf Moor is a football stadium in Burnley, Lancashire, England. It is the home ground of Premier League side Burnley Football Club, who have played there since moving from its Calder Vale ground in 1883. The stadium, which is situated on Harry Potts Way, named so after the club's longest serving Manager, has a capacity of 21,401, all seated. It was one of the last remaining stadiums in England to have the players' tunnel and dressing rooms behind one of the goals, until it was covered for seating in time for the 2014-15 Premier League season and rebuilt between the David Fishwick and James Hargreaves stand. The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885. Six years after this, the \"Star\" stand was erected and terracing was later added to the ends of the ground. After the Second World War, the stadium was redeveloped with all four stands being rebuilt. During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces were replaced by all-seater stands. Currently, the four stands at Turf Moor are the James Hargreaves Stand, the Jimmy McIlroy Stand, the Bob Lord Stand and the Cricket Field Stand.\r\n\r\nBurnley played their first match at the ground on 17 February 1883, losing 3\u20136 to local side Rawtenstall. When Prince Albert Victor opened a new hospital in Burnley in 1886, Turf Moor became the first football ground to be visited by a member of the British Royal Family. The first Football League match at the ground took place on 6 October 1888, with Fred Poland scoring the first competitive goal at the stadium. The record attendance at Turf Moor was set in 1924 when 54,755 people attended an FA Cup tie between Burnley and Huddersfield Town. In the same year, Turf Moor hosted its only FA Cup semi-final to date. In 1927, the stadium was the venue of an international match between England and Wales. Since then, the ground has been used to host matches in the European Under-19 Championship and European Under-21 Championship fixtures.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, plans for expansion of Turf Moor were released to the public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing \u00a320 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand and the moving of the players' entrance tunnel, have been put on hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, the development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced. Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor would eventually be 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAfter again achieving promotion to the Premier League in 2014 further Ground renovations were undertaken to comply with new regulations include housing for International Media, relocation of the players tunnel and upgrades to seating in the David Fishwick Stand for away supporters. On 26 June 2014 the club unveiled a planning application for extensions to the Turf Moor front entrance including the rebuilding of the official Club Shop containing a first floor museum.",

The club colours of claret and blue were adopted in 1910 in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, Aston Villa. It was thought the colours might lift and inspire Burnley to emulate the aforementioned side. Their home ground since 1883 has been Turf Moor.\r\n\r\nBurnley have been Football League Champions twice, in 1920\u201321 and 1959\u201360, and have won the FA Cup once, in 1914.

They are one of only three teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Preston North End.\r\n\r\nThe club spent most of their early history in England's top two divisions, but remained outside the top flight from 1976 to 2009. From 1985 to 1992 they had a seven-year spell in the lowest tier of the Football League. In 1987 they narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference. Between 2000 and 2009 they played in the second tier of English football, until they gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time in 33 years after winning the 2009 Championship play-off final, but were relegated after a single season.

It is the current home ground of Crystal Palace Football Club playing in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 the site, a former brickfield, was bought from the Brighton Railway Company for \u00a32,570. The stadium (designed by Scottish stadium architect Archibald Leitch) was constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around \u00a330,000, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London on 30 August 1924. There was then only one stand (the present Main Stand), but this was unfinished due to industrial action; Crystal Palace played Sheffield Wednesday and lost 0\u20131 in front of 25,000 fans.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1926, England played Wales in an international at the stadium. England amateur matches and various other finals were also staged there, as were other sports including boxing, bicycle polo (in the late 1940s) and cricket and music concerts (in the 1980s). In addition to this, it hosted two games for the 1948 Summer Olympics.\r\n\r\nIn 1953, the stadium's first floodlights were installed consisting of numerous poles around the 3 sides of terracing and four roof mounted installations on the Main Stand, but were replaced nine years later by floodlights mounted on, pylons in each corner and six installations on the Main Stand roof. Real Madrid marked the occasion by playing the first game under the new set of bulbs \u2013 a real footballing coup at the time for third division Palace, as it was Real's first ever match in London.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Crystal Palace Football Club is an English professional football club based in South Norwood, London. They currently play in the highest level in English football, the Premier League. Since 1964, the club have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football. The club was founded in 1905 at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue. Palace applied to be elected to The Football League, but this was rejected and they instead joined the Southern Football League Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club's initial nickname, \"The Glaziers\". Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the Football League Third Division. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the Second Division, where they spent four seasons before suffering relegation to the Third Division South. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of Division Four. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching the First Division in 1969, and staying in the top division for four seasons before suffering successive relegations. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to \"The Eagles\" and ending the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with promotions in 1977 and 1979, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two Champions. The period between 1989\u201391 was a successful time for the club. They reached an FA Cup Final in 1990, won the Full Members Cup in 1991, and achieved third place in the top division in the 1990\u20131991 season. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club then achieved promotion back to the Premier League three times in 1994, 1997 and 2004, but each time suffered relegation at the end of the following season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club were promoted back to the Premier League with a 1\u20130 win over Watford in the Football League play-offs in May 2013.\r\n\r\nCrystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the First World War saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. Since 1924, Palace have played their home games at Selhurst Park. Their home colours are red and blue vertical stripes, though prior to 1973 they wore claret and pale blue after the fashion of Aston Villa. They have a fierce rivalry with M23 neighbours Brighton & Hove Albion, with whom they have contested the M23 derby 98 times and also enjoy a strong rivalry with fellow South London team Millwall. The club's kit is currently made by Macron, and the shirt sponsor is Neteller. The club captain is Mile Jedinak and the current player of the year is Julian Speroni. Edmund Goodman is the club's longest serving manager, and Jim Cannon has made the most appearances for the club. Peter Simpson is the club's top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively. The highest transfer fee received has been for Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United in January 2013.",

      "strStadiumDescription": "Goodison Park is a football stadium located in Walton, Liverpool, England. The stadium has been home to Premier League club Everton F.C. since its completion in 1892 and is one of the world's oldest purpose-built football grounds. The stadium is built in a residential area served by regular rail and bus services two miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre.\r\n\r\nGoodison has undergone many changes over the years and it presently has an all-seated capacity of 39,572. Everton fans refer to the stadium as \"The Grand Old Lady\" and the abridged \"Goodison\".\r\n\r\nIt has hosted more top-flight games than any other stadium in England. Goodison has hosted the maximum number of league games since the Premier League was formed in 1992, as Everton have remained in the top tier of English football since 1954. The club has only been outside the top division for four seasons, having only been relegated twice (in 1930 and 1951).\r\n\r\nAs well as hosting Everton games, the stadium has been the venue for an FA Cup Final and numerous international fixtures, including several in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The record for the highest attendance in women's football was set at Goodison Park in 1920, which stood for 92 years until 31 July 2012. This game's high attendance resulted in women's football being banned by the Football Association for 50 years as they felt it threatened the men's game.\r\n\r\nGoodison Park was conceived in unusual circumstances: two factions of politicians on the Everton board grappled to control the destiny of the club. A split emerged with the members with the majority leaving their home at Anfield forming Goodison Park. Everton F.C.'s relocation to Goodison Park was one of the earliest cases of a team moving to a new stadium for monetary benefit.",

Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923.\r\n\r\nManchester City entered the Football League in 1899, and won their first major honour with the FA Cup in 1904. It had its first major period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, which eventually saw them relegated as far down as third tier of English football by the end of the 1997\u201398 season. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001\u201302 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002\u201303. In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by Abu Dhabi United Group for \u00a3210 million and received considerable financial investment.\r\n\r\nThe club have won six domestic league titles. Under the management of Pep Guardiola they won the Premier League in 2018 becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble. Manchester City's revenue was the fifth highest of a football club in the world in the 2018\u201319 season at \u20ac568.4 million. 2019, Forbes estimated the club was the fifth most valuable in the world at $2.69 billion, however the sale of a 10% stake in the club's parent company City Football Group on 27 November 2019 for $500 million values them significantly higher.",

With a capacity of 75,635, Old Trafford is the second-largest football stadium in the United Kingdom after Wembley Stadium, and the ninth-largest in Europe. It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram station.\r\n\r\nOld Trafford, nicknamed the Theatre of Dreams by Bobby Charlton, has been United's home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949, as a result of bomb damage during the Second World War, the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, which served to return the ground almost to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to over 90,000. The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.\r\n\r\nOld Trafford has hosted FA Cup semi-finals, England fixtures, matches at the 1966 World Cup and Euro 96 and the 2003 Champions League Final, as well as rugby league's annual Super League Grand Final and the final of two Rugby League World Cups. It also hosted football matches at the 2012 Summer Olympics, including women's international football for the first time in its history.",

Alex Ferguson won 28 major honours, and 38 in total, from November 1986 to May 2013, when he announced his retirement after 26 years at the club. On 19 May 2014, Louis van Gaal was appointed as the club's new manager after Ferguson's successor David Moyes was sacked after only 10 months in charge, with the club's record appearance-maker, Ryan Giggs, appointed as his assistant after a brief period as caretaker manager.\r\n\r\nManchester United is the third-richest football club in the world for 2011\u201312 in terms of revenue, with an annual revenue of \u20ac395.9 million, and the world's second most valuable sports team in 2013, valued at $3.165 billion. It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost \u00a3800 million, after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.",

El club se incorpor\u00f3 a la First Division en 1892. Tras estar cerca de la bancarrota en 1902, J. H. Davies tom\u00f3 las riendas del club y cambi\u00f3 el nombre, llam\u00e1ndolo Manchester United. Su estadio fue bombardeado durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial lo que motiv\u00f3 al club a buscar la caridad de sus vecinos del Manchester City, quienes les permitieron jugar en Maine Road durante un tiempo a cambio de un costo anual. El United nombr\u00f3 a Matt Busby como entrenador del equipo tras la guerra y su pol\u00edtica, por entonces inaudita, de la promoci\u00f3n de la mayor parte de los jugadores del equipo juvenil del club tuvo un gran \u00e9xito, al ganar la liga en 1956 y 1957.9 Este \u00e9xito tuvo un alto en el camino con el desastre a\u00e9reo de M\u00fanich de 1958, en el que ocho jugadores del equipo perdieron la vida.10 11 A pesar de dicha tragedia, el conjunto supo recuperarse y gan\u00f3 la liga en 1965 y 1967, as\u00ed como la Copa Europea en 1968. El club no tuvo de nuevo un \u00e9xito tan notable hasta la d\u00e9cada de 1990, cuando Alex Ferguson dirigi\u00f3 al equipo a la obtenci\u00f3n de ocho campeonatos ligueros en once a\u00f1os. En 1999, el Manchester United se convirti\u00f3 en el primer equipo ingl\u00e9s en ganar la Champions, la Premier League y la FA Cup en la misma temporada \u2014el \u00abtriplete\u00bb del club\u2014.12\r\n\r\nEntre sus principales logros a nivel nacional se encuentran haber ganado la First Division/Premier League en 20 ocasiones, la FA Cup en 11 y la Supercopa de Inglaterra en 20, r\u00e9cords absolutos en los tres casos, adem\u00e1s de cuatro ediciones de la Copa de la Liga de Inglaterra. A nivel europeo, ha obtenido tres veces la Liga de Campeones, empatado en s\u00e9ptimo lugar y segundo mejor ingl\u00e9s, adem\u00e1s de una Recopa de Europa.13 Es el \u00fanico club ingl\u00e9s en convertirse en campe\u00f3n mundial de clubes, al conquistar la Copa Intercontinental en 1999 y la Copa Mundial de Clubes de la FIFA en 2008, tras derrotar a los entonces campeones de Am\u00e9rica Palmeiras y Liga de Quito, respectivamente.\r\n\r\nLos principales rivales del Manchester United han sido el Liverpool y Manchester City, a quien se enfrenta en el derby de Manchester.\r\n\r\nEn la cultura popular, es considerado como uno de los m\u00e1s populares del mundo,14 debido a que cuenta con 659 millones de seguidores a nivel internacional hasta mayo de 2012, seg\u00fan una investigaci\u00f3n realizada por la empresa Kantar. De esta cifra, 325 millones provienen del continente asi\u00e1tico, 173 millones del Oriente Medio y \u00c1frica, 90 millones de Europa y finalmente 71 millones de Am\u00e9rica. De igual manera, ha tenido el promedio de asistencia m\u00e1s alto en el f\u00fatbol ingl\u00e9s desde 1957, salvo algunas excepciones en que ha sido superado por el Tottenham, Everton y Liverpool.17\r\n\r\nFinancieramente, el United se convirti\u00f3 en el primer equipo deportivo en superar un valor de 3 000 millones USD, para ser catalogada de esta forma como la franquicia deportiva mejor valuada del mundo, de acuerdo a la revista Forbes, un hito que ser\u00eda superado un par de meses despu\u00e9s por el tambi\u00e9n club de f\u00fatbol Real Madrid, con un valor de 3 300 millones USD.

Reluctance to move has led to the distinctive lop-sided appearance of the present-day stadium's asymmetrical stands.\r\n\r\nBesides club football, St. James' Park has also been used for international football, it was used as a football venue for the 2012 Olympics, and will also be used as a rugby venue for the 2015 Super League Magic Weekend as well as the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

As the largest stadium in Sheffield during the 19th century it hosted most of the city's most significant matches including the final of the world's first football tournament, first floodlit match and several matches between the Sheffield and London Football Associations that led to the unification of their respective rules. It was also used by Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield F.C. for major matches. It has been the home of Sheffield United since the club's establishment in 1889. It is the oldest major stadium in the world still to be hosting professional association football matches.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was built on a Sheffield road named after the Bramall family (who were file and graver manufacturers). The Bramalls owned \"The Old White House\" on the corner of Bramall Lane and Cherry Street, and subsequently built the Sheaf House, now a public house that still stands at the top of Bramall Lane. The stadium was originally opened as a cricket ground. It was also used for football games in the 19th century by Sheffield F.C. and Sheffield Wednesday but since 1889 it has been the home of Sheffield United.\r\n\r\nBramall Lane is one of only two grounds (the other being the Oval) which has hosted England football internationals (five games prior to 1930), an England cricket test match in 1902 against Australia and a FA Cup Final Replay in 1912, when Barnsley beat West Bromwich Albion, 1\u20130.

      "strStadiumDescription": "St Mary's Stadium is a stadium in Southampton, England, which has been the home of an English Premier league club, Southampton F.C. since 2001. The stadium has a capacity of 32,505 and is currently the largest football stadium in the South of England (excluding London).\r\nSince the 1980s, when Southampton regularly challenged the best sides in the English league (particularly in 1984 when they were league runners-up), there had been talk of the club relocating to a new stadium to replace The Dell due to the old stadium's cramped location which made it unsuitable for major expansion work.\r\n\r\nWhen the Taylor Report on 29 January 1990 required all First and Second Division clubs to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994, Southampton's directors initially decided to upgrade The Dell into an all-seater stadium (which was completed in 1993) but speculation about relocation continued, especially as an all-seater Dell had a capacity of just over 15,000; despite this, Southampton continued to defy the odds and survive in the new FA Premier League after 1992.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a new 25,000 seater stadium and leisure complex at Stoneham, on the outskirts of Southampton, the city council offered the club the chance to build a new ground on the disused gas work site in the heart of the city, about one and half miles from The Dell.\r\n\r\nThe move was cited as the club returning home, because the club was formed by members of the nearby St. Mary's Church, as the football team of St. Mary's Church Young Men's Association before becoming Southampton St. Mary's F.C., and eventually Southampton F.C.\r\n\r\nConstruction started in December 1999 and was completed at the end of July 2001, with work on the stadium itself and improvements to local infrastructure cost a total of \u00a332 million.\r\n\r\nThe Saints have been in residence since August 2001 when they moved from The Dell, which for the final years of its life, held just over 15,000 spectators \u2013 less than half the size of the new stadium. The first match was played on 1 August 2001 against RCD Espanyol, with the Spanish side winning 4\u20133.\r\n\r\nThe first competitive hat trick at the stadium was scored by Stafford Browne for Aldershot Town in a 3\u20131 victory over Havant & Waterlooville in the Hampshire Senior Cup final on 1 May 2002.",

The club has been nicknamed \"The Saints\" since its inception in 1885 due to its history as a church football team, founded as St Mary's Church of England Young Men's Association (or St Mary's Y.M.A) and has since generally played in red and white shirts.\r\n\r\nThe club has a long-standing rivalry with Portsmouth due to its close proximity and both cities' respective maritime history. Matches between the two sides are known as the South Coast Derby.\r\n\r\nThe club has won the FA Cup once in 1976, and their highest-ever league finish was second in the First Division in 1983\u201384. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on 15 May 2005 ending 27 successive seasons of top-division football for the club.

It has a planned capacity of 62,062, making it one of the largest in the Premier League and the largest for a club stadium in London. It is designed to be a multi-purpose stadium and features a world's-first dividing, retractable football pitch, that reveals a synthetic turf pitch underneath for NFL London Games, concerts and other events.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the stadium was initiated as the centrepiece of the Northumberland Development Project, intended to be the catalyst for a 20-year regeneration project in Tottenham. The project covers the site of the now demolished ground of White Hart Lane and areas adjacent to it. The project was first conceived in 2007 and announced in 2008, but the plan was revised several times, and the construction of the stadium, beset by disputes and delays, did not commence until 2015. The stadium is due to be completed during the 2018\u201319 season. The stadium is scheduled to open in 2019, with a ceremony before the first competitive game.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\" is a temporary name, the intention being to sell the naming rights to the stadium, so that it will be named after a sponsor. The stadium is occasionally referred to as New White Hart Lane by fans and some in the media.",

The club's home stadium is White Hart Lane. Its newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, making it the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League. Tottenham was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960\u201361 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 it became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition \u2013 the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1967 it won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and was the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When it won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that it had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades \u2013 an achievement only matched by Manchester United.\r\n\r\nThe club's Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: \"To Dare Is to Do\"), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby neighbours Arsenal, with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London derby.",

      "strStadiumDescription": "The Hawthorns is an all-seater football stadium in West Bromwich,Sandwell, England, with a capacity of 27,000. It has been the home of Premier League club West Bromwich Albion F.C. since 1900, when it became the sixth ground to be used by the club. The ground was the last Football League ground to be built in the 19th century. At an altitude of 551 feet (168 m), it is the highest ground among those of all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs.\r\nThe expiry of the lease on Stoney Lane, as well as the club's desire for a more spacious location, saw them move once again in 1900, this time permanently. All of Albion's previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up an \"out of town\" site on the borders of Handsworth. The area was covered in hawthorn bushes, which were cleared to make way for the new ground, hence its name, the Hawthorns. The club signed a lease for the land on 14 May 1900, giving them the option to buy within 14 years from the owner, Sandwell Park Colliery, and Albion did indeed buy the freehold on the ground in June 1913.\r\n\r\nWhen opened, the Hawthorns could hold around 35,500 spectators. The first match took place on Monday 3 September 1900, when Albion drew 1\u20131 with Derby County in front of a crowd of 20,104. Derby's England international Steve Bloomer scored the first Hawthorns goal, with Chippy Simmons equalizing for Albion. The first Saturday game followed soon after, with Albion losing out 0\u20131 to fierce local rivals Aston Villa in front of a capacity crowd, officially put at 35,417 but with many more forcing entry and an estimated 15,000 people locked out. The 1900\u201301 campaign was not a successful one however, as Albion finished bottom of the table and were relegated to Division Two. Their defeat to Sheffield United on the final day of the season was witnessed by just 1,050 spectators, which remains the record lowest crowd for a league game at the Hawthorns.",

It was originally constructed for the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics\u2014serving as the track and field venue, and as the site of their opening and closing ceremonies. Following the Games, the stadium was subsequently renovated as a multi-purpose stadium, with its primary tenant becoming West Ham United F.C.\r\n\r\nLand preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007, with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008. The stadium held its first public event in March 2012, serving as the finish line for a celebrity run organised by the National Lottery. Holding 80,000 for the Olympics and the Paralympics, the stadium re-opened in July 2016 with a capacity of 60,000. The decision to make West Ham United the main tenants was controversial, with the initial tenancy process having to be rerun.\r\n\r\nThe stadium hosted several 2015 Rugby World Cup matches, two England rugby league Test matches, and the 2017 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and 2017 World Para Athletics Championships (the first time both events had been held in the same location in the same year). The stadium can also hold concerts with up to 80,000 spectators, and, due to its oval shape and relocatable seating, was deemed to potentially be suitable for other sporting events such as baseball and cricket.",

      "strStadiumDescription": "Molineux Stadium (/\u02c8m\u0252l\u0268nju\u02d0/ mol-i-new) is a Championship football stadium situated in Whitmore Reans, Wolverhampton, England. It has been the home ground of Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club since 1889, and has a long and illustrious history as the first 'new build' stadium in Football League history, one of the first grounds in the country to install floodlights, as well as hosting some of the first European club games in the 1950s.\r\n\r\nAt the time of its multi-million pound renovation in the early 1990s, Molineux was one of the biggest and most modern stadia in England, though it has since been eclipsed by many other ground developments. The stadium has however hosted England internationals and, more recently, England under-21 internationals, as well as the first UEFA Cup Final in 1972. Although currently a 31,000 seater stadium, the record attendance at Molineux stands at 61,315.\r\n\r\nInitial plans were announced in May 2010 to rebuild two sides of the stadium by the 2014\u201315 season to increase capacity to around 36,000. The first stage of this project began in Summer 2011 and was completed on course for the start of the 2012\u201313 season. There are also provisional future plans for a longer term redevelopment of every stand that could potentially create a 50,000 capacity.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club Listeni/\u02ccw\u028alv\u0259r\u02c8h\u00e6mpt\u0259n/ (commonly referred to as Wolves) is an English professional football club that represents the city of Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. The club was originally known as St. Luke's FC and was founded in 1877 and since 1889 has played at Molineux. They currently compete in the Football League Championship, the second highest tier of English football, having been promoted from League One in 2014 after a solitary season at that level.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Wolves have been highly influential, most notably as being founder members of the Football League, as well as having played an instrumental role in the establishment of the European Cup, later to become the UEFA Champions League. Having won the FA Cup twice before the outbreak of the First World War, they developed into one of England's leading clubs under the management of ex-player Stan Cullis after the Second World War, going on to win the league three times and the FA Cup twice more between 1949 and 1960. It was during this time that the European Cup competition was established, after the English press declared Wolves \"Champions of the World\" following their victories against numerous top European and World sides in some of British football's first live televised games.\r\n\r\nWolves have yet to match the successes of the Stan Cullis era, although, under Bill McGarry, they contested the first-ever UEFA Cup final in 1972 and won the 1974 League Cup, a trophy they lifted again six years later under John Barnwell. However, financial mismanagement in the 1980s led to the club's very existence being under threat as well as three consecutive relegations, before a revival and back-to-back promotions under manager Graham Turner and record goalscorer Steve Bull saw them finish the decade in the Second Division, winning the Football League Trophy along the way.",
